 # Random Password Generator 
## Created by Joe Addamo

  * As an employee with access to sensitive data 
 
 * I Want to randomly generate a password that means certain criteria

  * When I click the button to generate a password,
  * Then I am presented with a new password, which gets stored in my last passwords history

  ## How it works
  * I can set the length criteria before generating the password 
  * the length of the criteria is changed via slider, who's value is dynamically displayed
  * When I generate a new password, I am provided with a randomly generated assortment of letters, numbers, and symbols that are predefined
  * I am able to reset the criteria and output fields with the reset generator button
  * I am able to copy the generated password to my clipboard via the copy password button
  * I am able to clear the password history via the clear history button
